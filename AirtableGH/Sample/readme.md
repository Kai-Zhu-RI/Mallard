This sample shows how to create a list of records in multiple fields in an Airtable table. Field type string and attachment are included.

According to Airtable API documentation, "To create new attachments in attachment fields, set the field value to an array of attachment objects. When creating an attachment, url is required."

In this sample, plugin jSwan was used to deserialize urls(string) to object(json).
